### Setup route table for public subnets

# We will have one Route Table for the public subnet.
# The Route Table for the public subnet will use the
# Internet Gateway as default gateway.
# We can use the same Route Table for the two public subnets,
# as their configuration is identical:
# they both use the internet gateway
# to reach the outside world.
#
# We don't see it here, but the Route Tables will also contain
# a route for resources inside the VPC, so that if we need
# to reach an internal resource, we don't go to the Internet
# Gateway or the NAT Gateway.
